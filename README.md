# Race_Car_Stimulation
"Race_Car_Stimulation" is developed in java which stimulates a car race where multiple cars compete on a racetrack. The simulation involves cars moving along the track, potentially getting damaged, and stopping for repairs at a pit stop. The race progresses as cars advance based on their speed, and events such as entering the pit stop, repairs, and crossing the finish line are logged. A logger keeps track of all key race events, such as cars starting, getting repaired, and finishing the race. The user can input parameters to set up the race, including the number of cars and track length. The program manages the race and records everything for review, creating an engaging simulation experience.
